# ADB Executor

ADB Executor is a project for my mentored research at UNC. The goal of it is to provide a web interface for experimentation with ADB, building infrastructure for mobile agents, and collection of data for model training.

## Startup

This project uses a node backend with Express JS. Install node, npm i, npm run start. Will have to cd into the server folder and install android platform tools.

### Device Usage

In order to use the software, you will have to connect an android device over USB-C or use the ADV (android virtual device) emulator.
