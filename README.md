# ADB Executor

ADB Executor is a project for my mentored research at UNC. The goal of it is to provide a web interface for experimentation with ADB, building infrastructure for mobile agents, and collection of data for model training.

## Startup

This project uses a node backend. Install node, npm i, npm run start.

Visit this page: https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads, and download the android platform tools. Place them in the root directory of the project.

Start the server by running npm run start.

### Device Usage

In order to use the software, you will have to connect an android device over USB-C or use the AVD (android virtual device) emulator inside of Android Studio.
